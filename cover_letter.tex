\lettersection{About Me}

I'm currently working on my bachelor thesis, 
its aim is to introduce brand new load balancing mechanism tailored specifically for optimization algorithms. 
This solution is based on the mathematical model of runtime optimization techniques as well as 
bleeding edge technologies used in the implementation of my custom optimization load balancer.
It allows to cut hardware resources cost paid while hosting application which contains optimization algorithm.

This year I will hopefully finish the Faculty of Electrical Engineering on Czech Technical University in Prague in Open Informatics programme 
with focus on Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence.

Apart from computer science, my free time is mainly focusing on the music. 
Since I was five years old, I was attending general music school where I was practicing clarinet, 
seven years later I started performing with International Orchestr "über Grenzen" which lead me to region wide clarinet competition,
where I won the first place (2014).

My working experience are not only from the Czech Republic, I was also working in the Paris at Softbank Robotics Headquater with the next-gen robot Pepper as a member of team sent by slovakia branch of world wide business consulting company Adastra

while I was studying on the grammar school in 2015, I was placed third in the national wide Computer Science related competition, this resulted into my nomination to various types of international events. I was representative of the Czech Republic on the Swiss Talent Forum 2017 in Bern.

While I was taking PJV course at CTU, I was part of international team which was working on the distributed system with aim to deliver data between distinguished devices and operating systems.

Working 2 years with bleeding edge technologies in the industry leading AI company in the superskilled international team with all over the world customers. I'm personally leading the team working on the state of the art scheduling system for major Chinese investor
